## Description
><p>Author: <code>tacex</code></p><p>The size of a Minecraft world is 60,000,000 * 60,000,000 * 384 blocks. If 256 different blocks are chosen to represent a byte of data, this means that a Minecraft world could store roughly 1.2 exabytes of data. Naturally, this must mean that Minecraft is the best storage system in terms of capacity, so I have decided to start storing my files in my world. Have fun recovering them!</p><p>Note: The file size is 8MB</p><p>Download from here: https://tamuctf.com/5d6b407ee061e8696136d4dfd25f24b0/static/mcfs.zip</p>
