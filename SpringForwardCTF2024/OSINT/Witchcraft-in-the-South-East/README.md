## Description
>b"Somewhere far in the South East, a hero from three centuries ago wrote up a manuscript. It detailed how practicioners from their era should deal with the afflicted. Some say the affliction is incurable as if a spell were cast on them. Unfortunately, this national hero would later be executed for some of his other writings. I wonder if you can help me find the name of this manuscript?\r\n\r\nFlag should be the name of the paper in its untranslated form, with each word separated by a -. Diacritics or accent marks on letters are not required.\r\n\r\nExample: `nicc{Of-Mice-and-Men}`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: BonsaiUmai"
