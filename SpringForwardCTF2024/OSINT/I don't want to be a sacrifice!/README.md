## Description
>b"Simon Letti got lost in time again... \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, his professor refused to let him go see the Eclipse. He was so excited, too! Apparently his professor thought it wasnt worth it since NJIT wasnt going to get a total eclipse.\r\n\r\nHe was so upset he decided he was going to mix two of his favorite things: space and ancient civilizations. Maybe hes been watching too much Stargate?\r\n\r\nHe wouldnt say where he was going, but he was supposed to check in with Anna every 24 hours so we know he was safe but its been a week already! \r\n\r\nIf we can find out when and where he was going we can probably go back and save him!\r\n\r\nHis dorm had a message on the door:\r\n\r\n\r\n> Anna, \r\n> Prof was right - we werent going to see it fully here... \r\n> But I found the perfect eclipse! \r\n> \r\n> It was just over \xf0\x9d\x8b\xa5 long at the Kukulkans Castle! \r\n> And its brand new, so itll be awesome.\r\n> Can you tell Ive been practicing their language so I can communicate when Im there? \r\n> They talk in numbers, right?\r\n> Anyway, Ill see ya back in \xf0\x9d\x8b\xa5\xf0\x9d\x8b\xab\xf0\x9d\x8b\xa4 -- hopefully!\r\n> \r\n> Dont worry, Ill check in!\r\n> \r\n> - Simon\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we can find the date of the eclipse and where he was going, we can probably get him back in time for the fall semester!\r\n\r\nflag format: `nicc{YYYY-MM-DD_City-Name}`\r\n**You can ignore any accents on the city name, if there are any.
