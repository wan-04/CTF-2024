## Description
>* We received a copy of a painting today that was given to The Council.\r\n* It seems to be a copy of The Fall of Atlantis by the artist Fran\xc3\xa7ois de Nom\xc3\xa9.\r\n* Scribbled on the back of the painting was a message that read:\r\n\r\n```Those who wander are lost.\r\nThose who gather are found.\r\nThose who seek are blind.\r\nThose who see are bound.\r\n\r\nTo help hide our home,\r\nwe sought to deceive,\r\nAnd told those who roam,\r\nthat we were lost to the seas.\r\n\r\nOnly when you eXamine `truth of time`\r\nbY `LIES FROM OLD` \r\nWill you find the map\r\nTo our home of gold.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is probably nothing... right?\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/alfredsimpson)
