## Description
>b"Zeus is throwing the party of eons at the The Gardens of the Hesperides!!! Hermes is going to pick you up, but in order to get in you need to tell him the passcode or hes gonna leave you stranded! You have no idea what the passcode is, but you have a drinking cup, a party gift from the last one. Take a look at it, maybe theres a clue on it on what the password was. It belonged to an oracle that got so drunk, they went on a vision spell way into the future and started tweaking out!! They were biting into their cup, making clicky noises, scratching into it, rubbing the paint off. Look at the thing! It barely held up.\r\n\r\nFlag format: `nicc{flag}`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: [rickyhernandez1000](https://github.com/rickyhernandez1000)"
