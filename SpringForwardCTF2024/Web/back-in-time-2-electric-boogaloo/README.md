## Description
>b"Great job gaining access to the site! We managed to get a hold of some of the code thats making the site work. The source that provided us the code also told us that the time machines owner is trying to go back in time to find Koalemos. Why? Who knows! That isnt important right now.\r\n\r\nThe time machine currently does not appear to be working. Im not saying its a refrigerator box...but its totally a refrigerator box.\r\n\r\nAnyways, we think there is still some information hidden on the server. Can you find how to get it it?\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: [Noah Jacobson](https://github.com/noahajac)"
