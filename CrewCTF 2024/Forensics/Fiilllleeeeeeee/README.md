## Description
>I plugged in a USB and it encrypted my files. Luckily I had the initiative to take an image of the USB after the encryption occurred (fiilllleeeeeeee.ad1). Can you find a way of decrypting my most important file (flag.txt)?\r\n\r\nNote: The ransomware in the image should be harmless as it only targets a specific directory that is incredibly unlikely to exist by chance.\r\n\r\nThe .zip password is fiilllleeeeeeee.\r\n\r\nAuthor : Oshawk
