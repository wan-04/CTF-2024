## Description
>"In the land of echoes, where whispers roam, A tale of clues, finds its home. Laughter and tears, merge in the air, In echoes\ parody, stories flare.\r\nFootsteps of past, meet those of now, In the echo\s chamber, they take a bow. Love\s sweet whispers, pain\s bitter cry, All in the echoes, they do lie.\r\nListen close, and you will find, Clues and whispers, intertwined. In the echo\s game, secrets unfurl, A world of mysteries, for all to swirl."\r\n\r\nLink: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GPdculNuobTkrOPRX898Z69_WkPDWEUi/view
