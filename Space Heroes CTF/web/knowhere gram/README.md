## Description
>Rocket:** Hey there, listen up you bunch of space-squid snacks! Heard you jabronis on Earth are all stuck in this "social media" craze. Bunch of flickering lights and useless chatter. Not exactly my cup of space-grog, y\know?\r\n\r\nWell, us folks on Knowhere? We ain\t got time for that junk. But I figured I\d cook up a little somethin\ somethin\ for you knuckleheads. A Knowhere-made social media app, just for our little corner of the cosmos. Fancy, huh?  Think of it as a galactic bulletin board, but with less spitwads and chewing gum.\r\n\r\nNow, don\t go gettin\ all trigger-happy just yet. For now, only **yours truly the Rocket** can upload any images. Gotta make sure this shindig doesn\t turn into a three-eyed freakshow before I unleash it on the whole lot of ya. We wouldn\t want Knowhere to be flooded with blurry pictures of Cosmo the Space Dog chasing his tail and mistaking it for a space pirate, would we? Yeah, that was a confusing week for everyone.\r\n\r\nBackup link: http://srv3.martiansonly.net:1111/\r\n\r\n[http://knowhere.martiansonly.net](http://knowhere.martiansonly.net)\r\n\r\nAuthor: bl4ckp4r4d1s3
