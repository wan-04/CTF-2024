## Description
>Lost in the labyrinthine calculations of planetary motion, I stumbled upon an anomaly. Ancient Greek symbols, not our modern equations, whispered of celestial mechanics. Driven by a scientist\s curiosity, I cracked their cryptic code. The unearthed knowledge, a testament to their forgotten ingenuity, fueled the creation of the "Greek Astronomical Calculator." This isn\t just a tool for prediction; it\s a portal to a bygone era\s uncanny understanding of the cosmos\r\n\r\n[http://antikythera.martiansonly.net](http://antikythera.martiansonly.net)\r\n\r\nAuthor: bl4ckp4r4d1s3
