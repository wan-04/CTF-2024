## Description
>b"# Sponsored by [Merck Pharmaceuticals](https://www.merck.com/)\r\n* Im pretty bummed. I thought I came up with a novel way of backdooring your brain using AI, but somebody beat me to it last month! Even worse - theyre claiming a 100% attack success rate with this Trojan attack! \r\n* I looked into this guy, and hes pretty solid... been winning awards for 21 years now! His partner isnt a slouch either - in fact I think the duo just wrote a book together. Pretty cool considering that the primary author served as his advisor for his co-authors dissertation.\r\n* I need to learn what the primary author knows, but I also have a bad memory. Can you give me the last names of each of the authors. Also, can you find the last book he wrotes ISBN (hardcover, please) and then tell me who *he* learned from while getting his PhD? I heard it was someone who runs their own lab, too, back at his alma mater. His old teacher was his advisor for his dissertation - so you know they know something great - I just cant find them myself. If you get me his teacher/advisors last name Ill track them down.\r\n* Its either I learn now, or hope I wait a couple of decades to use what their tech... and who knows where tech will be by then?\r\n\r\n**Flag Format:**\r\nRemove all hyphens from the isbn (digits only!), use proper capitalization for last names. Separate each item with an underscore.\r\n\r\nExample: `jctf{PrimaryAuthorLastName_CoAuthorLastName_isbn_TeacherLastName}`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/AlfredSimpson)"
