## Description
>b"* Okay, this is weird. They had a whole forum going.\r\n* There must be something worthwhile in there. We knew that something like this was happening, but I wasnt sure what wed find.\r\n* If they were posting here someone probably slipped up along the way.\r\n* We need to identify where and when they met with the agent who slipped them the intel.\r\n* Build your case on these members and, from that, we may identify the mole.\r\n* Do not slow down. A rolling stone gathers no moss, so time to shed the green, noobie.\r\n\r\nFlag Format: `jctf{mm-dd-yyyy_Venue-Name}`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/alfredsimpson)"
