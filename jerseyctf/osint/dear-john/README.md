## Description
>b"## Description\r\n* Joining a club is a fantastic way to meet people, make friends, further your educational and professional career, stop baddies, and have fun during your undergrad years. I definitely recommend it - and have made some great friends through clubs Ive been in.\r\n* You can always tell who was friends and who wasnt - theyll be in a lot of the same clubs!\r\n* While some clubs, like NICC, attract people who are looking at professional development, others bring together people from multiple degree programs.\r\n* The father of AI had a probable friend who became a pretty well known biologist. \r\n* Think you can tell me the clubs they were in and his friends last name? Alphabetical order, please.\r\n\r\n**Flag Format:** no spaces in club names, Capitalize it like its a proper noun, and separate each part with an underscore. ex: jctf{ClubName_Club_Lastname}\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/AlfredSimpson)"

**Hint**
* How could you find out what clubs someone was in SO long ago?
