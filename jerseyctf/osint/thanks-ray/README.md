## Description
>b"* Im not gonna lie. With all of the information Im absorbing, Im about to lose my mind. Its times like these that I understand how someone could go crazy like Mr. 4-sided-earth himself. Okay, maybe not as crazy as him, but you get the idea.\r\n* Speaking of - I really do wonder how he got obssessed with cubes. \r\n* Simon got an interview with him the other day where it seems like it wasnt just about cubes... \r\n* Ray mentioned writing it down, but I thought he only wrote the blog.\r\n* I guess Im wrong. Mind finding it for me? Stick to the federal stuff, please - Ray didnt trust the Googles.\r\n* When you find it, tell me  what he was doing business as when he published the book, the page count, and the alpha-numberic registration id.\r\n\r\nFlag Format: `jctf{NameOfCo._pagecount_AB1234}` - No spaces in name and as it appears.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/alfredsimpson)"
