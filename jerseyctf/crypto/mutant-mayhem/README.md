## Description
>To prevent the RB from impersonating any communications coming from you to our team, we need to employ an extremely secure digital signature algorithm. One of the most secure signature algorithms out there is the one used for bitcoin and ehtereum. Using the same Elliptic Curve used for those cryptocurrency calculations, hash and send me the message "Establishing a Secure Connection... :)". You also needed to provide me with the signature so that I can verify what was sent. The private key and other needed information is included in the file attached. Good luck agent! \r\n\r\nFlag Format: `jctf{hashedMessage, (r, s)}`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: [thatLoganGuy](https://github.com/thatLoganGuy)
