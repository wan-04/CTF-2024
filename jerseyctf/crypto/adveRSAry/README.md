## Description
>b"You have intercepted an encrypted message from the RB back to Dr. Tom!!!! The component values of Dr. Toms public key are obviously readily available, but one of the components of his private keys was accidentally published as well! Weve been eavesdropping on channels that Dr. Tom frequently uses, maybe these keys can be used to decrypt this traffic? The included files contain a message to decrypt, and the key components discussed.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by [thatLoganGuy](https://github.com/thatLoganGuy)"

**Hint**
* b"The component of the private key that was accidentally published isnt enough to decrypt the message on its own. What other information can you derive from the public key components and private key component you have?"
