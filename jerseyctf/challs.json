However, something seems to be amiss with two of your co-workers Rick and Shane. There has recently been a breach of company secrets on the dark web, and rival companies are excited to rival Weyland Yutani in the asteroid mining business. You suspect Rick and Shane are responsible for this theft, but in order to get the evidence to convict them, you need to determine the shared secret key they've been using. By tailing them around the office, you've recovered several artifacts that may help you determine their shared key.  Rick and Shane are new at this, you should verify these artifacts for accuracy. These artifacts include a half-erased whiteboard from one of Rick and Shane's breakout meetings, two screenshots from Rick's computer, and a scrap of paper that didn't make it into Shane's trash can. \r\n\r\nFlag Format: `jctf{(,)}`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: [thatLoganGuy](https://github.com/thatLoganGuy)",
