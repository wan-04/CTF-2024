## Description
>b"We are so happy to announce our very friendly & pretty basic chatbot! All was going well with it however, it must have ticked someone off that they decided to try to hack into the server and try to exploit it. This application, while seemingly benign, now contains hidden functionalities and potentially dangerous vulnerabilities reminiscent of the infamous `Log4j` exploit. We are asking for your help to step in and try to see how they got in. Your objective is to uncover these vulnerabilities, understand how they can be exploited, and ultimately use your findings to extract the flag hidden within the applications environment.\r\n\r\n[Click Me!
