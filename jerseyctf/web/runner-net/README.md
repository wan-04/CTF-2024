## Description
>b"Great work cracking that pcap file! I think we saw some interesting traffic, and we were definitely onto something with Dr Toms blog. Unfortunately - security seems tight. \r\n\r\nBut fortunately for us - people are the weakest link and some people might still be celebrating st. paddys based on this network capture we grabbed. Check it out and see if they slipped up anywhere.  It might be helpful to cross compare the old one, while youre at it.\r\n\r\nI cant help but think theres more than that. Mary and Maya said they found a way in, but typical them - theyre MIA. \r\nProbably back dancing the night away again.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Flag format:** Exactly as it appears, which will be in the format `jctf{some_text}`.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/AlfredSimpson)"
