## Description
>b"* Linux really lets you do anything... when messing around with my new install, I managed to delete my bootloader! \r\n * Now I cant get in when I had an important file on my desktop... at least I virtualized it, maybe you can get the data out of it?\r\n\r\n Please download the file [here](https://njit-jerseyctf.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rescue/mynewvm.7z).\r\n \r\n Backup download link file [here](https://njit-jerseyctf.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rescue/mynewvm.7z?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAUOXRGBUXGO462C4J%2F20240319%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240319T181843Z&X-Amz-Expires=604700&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=342c04bc667bb8f687f99fc62ba3c8adc4d244e54ce3d00f32f7eda84f0815fc).\r\n \r\n `Note: If the file is downloaded as an extension other than .7z file, that is the incorrect extension.`\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Daniel M.](https://github.com/dmarriello)"

**Hint**
* b"The rescue console doesnt seem to let you read the files... seems like you need to use some other method. Perhaps you can find some tool that reads the data without launching the system? Maybe even one youve already used?"
