## Description
>Our informant has met back with us at base. He has stolen a file from a suspect who\xe2\x80\x99s starting to show dangerous signs of cyberpsychosis. Aside from his unending lust for bloodshed, our informant noted that the suspect would not shut up about \xe2\x80\x9crats making him crazy\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the  term \xe2\x80\x9cBase FFFF+1\xe2\x80\x9d but that\xe2\x80\x99s probably just nonsense. Anyways, can you look beyond the layers of this corrupted file to extract the information that we need? \r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [BonsaiUmai](https://github.com/JustinTecson)
