## Description
>b"While preparing for JerseyCTF IV last month, I was going to help with updating our main website over at [jerseyctf.com](https://jerseyctf.com)...\r\nAs it turns out, I might have made a mistake when updating stuff and some of the staff are pretty disappointed with me now...\r\nI thought it was fine! It didnt even show up on the website visibly... oh well.... hopefully no one was viewing the website all the way back last month.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Daniel M.](https://github.com/DMarriello)"

**Hint**
* Is there a way to view a mistake made in the past even if it was deleted since then?
