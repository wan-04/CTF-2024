## Description
>Your neighbors down the block own a small retail business that is taking off! Their sales are doing great, their customers are happy and employment is stable too. A random afternoon you get a call from them saying they think they were **hacked** (OH NO)! As the well known, *and super knowledgeable cyber security specialist you are*, you run down to try to help them remediate the problem ASAP. You notice that there is some sort of malware on the accounting computer, that is asking for encryption authentication. You need to figure out the code to get in there and find that flag! One piece of evidence was found in the network on one of the servers, check the network and see what you can find, the more time they have on there, the more they can take for ransom! \r\n\r\nFlag Format (all uppercase): `jctf{FLAG1_FLAG2_FLAG3}`\r\n\r\n***NOTE***: Windows, Mac, and Linux systems are able to use Cisco Packet Tracer.\r\n\r\nYou can create an account and download Cisco Packet Tracer for free from the website: [HERE](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracerdownload) or you can find a copy of packet tracer [HERE](https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/download-packet-tracer-for-windows-and-linux.html)\r\n\r\nDeveloped by: [Jack](https://github.com/JohnZabriskie)
