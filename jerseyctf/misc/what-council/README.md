## Description
>b"* Remember that image file from sticky situation?\r\n * We had a witness come forward saying they saw the suspect leaving Cullimores basement - right where we found the laptop.\r\n * Not sure if what theyre saying is useful or true, but they claim the suspect was muttering something about The Council.\r\n \r\n * Whos the council?\r\n \r\n * You still have that ad1, right?\r\n * If not: go get it. Youre going to need it.\r\n \r\n * If *memory* serves me right, there was a flyer around campus talking about the council a while back. Maybe its that?\r\n\r\nDeveloped by:\t [Cyb0rgSw0rd](https://github.com/alfredsimpson)"
