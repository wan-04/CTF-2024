# Intern Retaliation Arc [980 pts]

**Category:** We
**Solves:** 3

## Description
>So it seems like our intern got a little pissed off we bossed him around and he pwned our website and is now holding us for ransom. We didn\t have the budget for backups so we\re kind of screwed.\r\n\r\nI remember one of our developers had a page he was using to test some backend stuff. Something about finding "bugs" in the cloud? Not really sure what he meant as clouds don\t have bugs inside of them. Weird.\r\n\r\nCheck it out and see if you can recover anything that might let us back in!\r\n\r\nFlag format: CIT{example_flag}
