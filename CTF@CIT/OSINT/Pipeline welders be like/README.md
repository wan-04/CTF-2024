## Description
>b"I just got off a 144 hour shift in the fields doing some tig welding. You wouldnt really understand. Anyways, I found a picture of this welding machine online. I love me some old welding machines so Im thinking about buying it. However, it would need some parts.\r\n\r\nCan you find me an Ebay listing selling some parts for a machine like this? I really just need to know what town is north from a certain sellers location so I can go pick up some parts for it.\r\n\r\nFormat: CIT{townname}"
