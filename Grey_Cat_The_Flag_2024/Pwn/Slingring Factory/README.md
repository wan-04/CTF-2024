Upon closer inspection, you realise that the rings seem very familiar -- they looked exactly like the Sling Rings you saw from the Marvel Comics universe! Having some time leftover, you decide to explore the factory. Alas, you eventually come to realise that these Sling Rings were in fact not the same as those you knew: during forging, their destinations have to already be set. You wonder what you could do with these rings...\r\n\r\nAuthor: uhg"
